          Hi there! I'm a software engineer with a love for all things code.
When I'm not busy debugging and writing efficient algorithms, you can find me hiking in the great outdoors or trying out new recipes in the kitchen.
I'm a strong believer in the power of teamwork and collaboration, and I'm always looking for ways to make a positive impact through my work.
So if you're in need of a tech-savvy problem-solver with a dash of whimsy, look no further!

            I started web developement managing multiple e-commerce
            websites on CMS platforms such as WordPress, BigCommerce, and
            Shopify. I have experience working directly with clients and taking
            mock wireframes all the way to deployed applications. In my spare
            time I run Code Commerce, a Youtube channel where I teach web
            developement and various front-end technologies.
